						<h1>Lobster Bake</h1>
					</header>
					<br>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<pre>
					<ul>
						<li>15 pounds of seaweed (your fish person can get you some)</li>
						<li>16 (1 1/2 pound) lobsters</li>
						<li>16 ears corn, shucked</li>
						<li>5 pounds red potatoes, parboiled halfway in salted water</li>
						<li>10 pounds soft shell clams</li>
						<li>1 (750 ml) bottle white wine, preferably a Chardonnay</li>
						<li>2 yards of wet burlap or canvas (easy to find at a fabric store)</li>
						<li>Special equipment: #3 galvanized wash tub (easy to find at a local hardware store)</li>
					</ul>
				</pre>
					<h2>Directions</h2>
					<p>
						Start the fire 1 hour in advance, making sure the coals are white hot before you begin cooking.
						Add several rocks or flat cinder blocks to surround the fire and make sure they
						are positioned to hold the tub up at least 4 inches over the hot coals.
						Spread 1/2 of the seaweed on the bottom of the tub to protect the lobsters from burning.
						Place lobsters on top of seaweed.
						Place the corn on top of the lobster, and the potatoes on top of the corn.
						Arrange the raw clams on top of the vegetables and top with the remaining seaweed.
						Pour the wine into the tub.
						Place the wet burlap or canvas over the food and tuck the edges into the tub to retain the steam inside.
						Place the tub on top of the rocks & hot coals. Every 15 minutes, moisten the burlap with water.
						Cook for about 45 minutes. Remove the tub from the hot coals and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
						Carefully remove the hot burlap and seaweed with fire resistant gloves. Discard the seaweed. Remove
						the rest of the contents with gloves or tongs.
						Serve the lobster bake strewn out on newspapers, or lined vinyl
						tablecloth, with melted butter, empty buckets for shells, lobster
						crackers & picks, bibs & lots of napkins, and favorite spices as condiments.
						Gather your family and friends and enjoy your authentic DownEast Lobster Bake.

						<h1>Blueberry Pie</h1>
					</header>
					<br>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<h3>Pastry </h3>
					<pre>
					<ul>

						<li>2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>

						<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

						<li>2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening</li>

						<li>4 to 6 tablespoons cold water</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Filling</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>

						<li>1/2 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>

						<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, if desired</li>

						<li>6 cups blueberries</li>

						<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

						<li>1 tablespoon butter or margarine, if desired</li>
					</ul>
				</pre>
					<h2>Steps</h2>
					<p>
						1 In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and the salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).
						2 Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.
						3 Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.
						4 In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/2 cup flour and the cinnamon. Stir in blueberries. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Sprinkle any remaining sugar mixture over blueberry mixture. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over blueberries. Cover with top pastry that has slits cut in it; seal and flute. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.
					5 Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours.</p>

						<h1>Stawberry Rhubarb Pie</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<pre>
					<ul>
						<li>Pie Filling</li>
						<li>2 cups of rhubarb, outer, stringy layer removed completely, and chopped into ½" chunks</li>
						<li>4 cups of fresh strawberries, hulled and halved if they are small, quartered if they're large</li>
						<li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
						<li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
						<li>4 tablespoons minute tapioca</li>
						<li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
						<li>2 tablespoons butter, cubed small</li>
						<li>1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon of water</li>
						<li>Large granule sugar</li>
						<li>Use Pillsbury ready-made pie crusts</li>
					</ul>
				</pre>
					<h2>Directions</h2>
					<p>
						Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the rhubarb, strawberries, sugars, tapioca and orange juice in a large bowl. Set aside.
						Place prepared pie crust in a 9-inch pie dish. Pour the strawberry rhubarb filling into the pie crust. Dot the top of the pie mixture with the cubed butter. Brush edges of pie crust with egg white wash. Place the other piece of dough over filling. Crimp to seal edges and cut decorative slits into the top of the pie crust.
						Brush with egg white wash. Cover the crust with aluminum foil. Place on the middle rack of the oven. This pie may bubble over, so take care to use a sheet of aluminum foil under it to catch drips. Bake at 400 degrees F for 50 minutes, or until the pie is golden brown and juices are bubbling. Remove foil last 10 minutes to brown edges if needed. Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle liberally with sugar.
						Cool on a wire rack for 90 minutes to 2 hours. Serve with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream!

						<h1>DownEast Apple Pie</h1>
						<br>

					</header>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<ul>
						<pre>
							<br>
							<li>
								Pie Crusts
								Use Pillsbury ready-made pie
								crusts or your favorite scratch pie crust recipe
								Pie Filling.  For the perfect
								texture and taste, mix 5 tender-tart apples,
								such as Golden Delicious, with 5 firm-sweet ones,
								like Granny Smith. The tender apples cook down
								and create a sort of thick sauce, in which the
								firmer slices are suspended.
							</li>
							<li>5 large Golden Delicious apples peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
							<li>5 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
							<li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
							<li>4 tablespoons firmly packed light-brown sugar</li>
							<li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
							<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
							<li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
							<li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
							<li>3 tablespoons butter
								<li>2 tablespoons Arrowroot powder or cornstarch</li>
								<li>Milk to brush on to the top crust</li>
							</pre>
						</ul>
						<h2>Directions</h2>
						<p>
							Preheat oven to 425°
							Set one rack to the lowest position. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a large microwave proof bowl, stir apples with sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cook on high for 4 (or 5) minutes in the microwave, stirring gently every few minutes, until apples just begin to turn tender.
							Remove apples from the microwave, stir in Arrowroot (or cornstarch).  Place the bowl in your fridge to cool to room temperature - 15 minutes.
							Remove apples from the fridge and use a spatula to transfer them, with any juices, into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate that has been lined with your prepared crust. Dot the top of the apple mixture with butter. Transfer the second prepared pie crust on top of the pie. Using a sharp knife, make three slashes in the crust to let steam escape. Fold the bottom crust up over the top crust and crimp to seal. Brush crust all over lightly with milk and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar.
							Protect the crimped edge from overbrowning with foil strips.
							Put the pie on a baking sheet and bake it at 425 F for 40 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 and bake about 20 minutes longer. Remove the foil strips the last 10 minutes to brown. You will know when the pie is done when it starts to bubble through the vents and turns golden brown. Let cool on a rack for at least 45 minutes before serving.
