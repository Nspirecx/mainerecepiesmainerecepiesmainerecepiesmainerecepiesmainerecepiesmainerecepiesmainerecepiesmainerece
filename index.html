						<h1>Lobster Bake</h1>
					</header>
					<br>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<pre>
					<ul>
						<li>15 pounds of seaweed (your fish person can get you some)</li>
						<li>16 (1 1/2 pound) lobsters</li>
						<li>16 ears corn, shucked</li>
						<li>5 pounds red potatoes, parboiled halfway in salted water</li>
						<li>10 pounds soft shell clams</li>
						<li>1 (750 ml) bottle white wine, preferably a Chardonnay</li>
						<li>2 yards of wet burlap or canvas (easy to find at a fabric store)</li>
						<li>Special equipment: #3 galvanized wash tub (easy to find at a local hardware store)</li>
					</ul>
				</pre>
					<h2>Directions</h2>
					<p>
						Start the fire 1 hour in advance, making sure the coals are white hot before you begin cooking.
						Add several rocks or flat cinder blocks to surround the fire and make sure they
						are positioned to hold the tub up at least 4 inches over the hot coals.
						Spread 1/2 of the seaweed on the bottom of the tub to protect the lobsters from burning.
						Place lobsters on top of seaweed.
						Place the corn on top of the lobster, and the potatoes on top of the corn.
						Arrange the raw clams on top of the vegetables and top with the remaining seaweed.
						Pour the wine into the tub.
						Place the wet burlap or canvas over the food and tuck the edges into the tub to retain the steam inside.
						Place the tub on top of the rocks & hot coals. Every 15 minutes, moisten the burlap with water.
						Cook for about 45 minutes. Remove the tub from the hot coals and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
						Carefully remove the hot burlap and seaweed with fire resistant gloves. Discard the seaweed. Remove
						the rest of the contents with gloves or tongs.
						Serve the lobster bake strewn out on newspapers, or lined vinyl
						tablecloth, with melted butter, empty buckets for shells, lobster
						crackers & picks, bibs & lots of napkins, and favorite spices as condiments.
						Gather your family and friends and enjoy your authentic DownEast Lobster Bake.

						<h1>Blueberry Pie</h1>
					</header>
					<br>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<h3>Pastry </h3>
					<pre>
					<ul>

						<li>2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>

						<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

						<li>2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening</li>

						<li>4 to 6 tablespoons cold water</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Filling</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>

						<li>1/2 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>

						<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, if desired</li>

						<li>6 cups blueberries</li>

						<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

						<li>1 tablespoon butter or margarine, if desired</li>
					</ul>
				</pre>
					<h2>Steps</h2>
					<p>
						1 In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and the salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).
						2 Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.
						3 Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.
						4 In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/2 cup flour and the cinnamon. Stir in blueberries. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Sprinkle any remaining sugar mixture over blueberry mixture. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over blueberries. Cover with top pastry that has slits cut in it; seal and flute. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.
					5 Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours.</p>
