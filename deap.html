			<h1>DownEast Apple Pie</h1>
		</header>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<pre>
				<li>
					Pie Crusts
					Use Pillsbury ready-made pie
					crusts or your favorite scratch pie crust recipe
					Pie Filling.  For the perfect
					texture and taste, mix 5 tender-tart apples,
					such as Golden Delicious, with 5 firm-sweet ones,
					like Granny Smith. The tender apples cook down
					and create a sort of thick sauce, in which the
					firmer slices are suspended.
				</li>
				<li>5 large Golden Delicious apples peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
				<li>5 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges</li>
				<li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li>4 tablespoons firmly packed light-brown sugar</li>
				<li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
				<li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
				<li>3 tablespoons butter
					<li>2 tablespoons Arrowroot powder or cornstarch</li>
					<li>Milk to brush on to the top crust</li>
				</pre>
			</ul>
			<h2>Directions</h2>
			<p>
				Preheat oven to 425°
				Set one rack to the lowest position. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a large microwave proof bowl, stir apples with sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cook on high for 4 (or 5) minutes in the microwave, stirring gently every few minutes, until apples just begin to turn tender.
				Remove apples from the microwave, stir in Arrowroot (or cornstarch).  Place the bowl in your fridge to cool to room temperature - 15 minutes.
				Remove apples from the fridge and use a spatula to transfer them, with any juices, into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate that has been lined with your prepared crust. Dot the top of the apple mixture with butter. Transfer the second prepared pie crust on top of the pie. Using a sharp knife, make three slashes in the crust to let steam escape. Fold the bottom crust up over the top crust and crimp to seal. Brush crust all over lightly with milk and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar.
				Protect the crimped edge from overbrowning with foil strips.
				Put the pie on a baking sheet and bake it at 425 F for 40 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 and bake about 20 minutes longer. Remove the foil strips the last 10 minutes to brown. You will know when the pie is done when it starts to bubble through the vents and turns golden brown. Let cool on a rack for at least 45 minutes before serving.
