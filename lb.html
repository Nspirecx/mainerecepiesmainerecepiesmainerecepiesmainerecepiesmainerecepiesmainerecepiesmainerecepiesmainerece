		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<pre>
		<ul>
			<li>15 pounds of seaweed (your fish person can get you some)</li>
			<li>16 (1 1/2 pound) lobsters</li>
			<li>16 ears corn, shucked</li>
			<li>5 pounds red potatoes, parboiled halfway in salted water</li>
			<li>10 pounds soft shell clams</li>
			<li>1 (750 ml) bottle white wine, preferably a Chardonnay</li>
			<li>2 yards of wet burlap or canvas (easy to find at a fabric store)</li>
			<li>Special equipment: #3 galvanized wash tub (easy to find at a local hardware store)</li>
		</ul>
	</pre>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<p>
			Start the fire 1 hour in advance, making sure the coals are white hot before you begin cooking.
			Add several rocks or flat cinder blocks to surround the fire and make sure they
			are positioned to hold the tub up at least 4 inches over the hot coals.
			Spread 1/2 of the seaweed on the bottom of the tub to protect the lobsters from burning.
			Place lobsters on top of seaweed.
			Place the corn on top of the lobster, and the potatoes on top of the corn.
			Arrange the raw clams on top of the vegetables and top with the remaining seaweed.
			Pour the wine into the tub.
			Place the wet burlap or canvas over the food and tuck the edges into the tub to retain the steam inside.
			Place the tub on top of the rocks & hot coals. Every 15 minutes, moisten the burlap with water.
			Cook for about 45 minutes. Remove the tub from the hot coals and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
			Carefully remove the hot burlap and seaweed with fire resistant gloves. Discard the seaweed. Remove
			the rest of the contents with gloves or tongs.
			Serve the lobster bake strewn out on newspapers, or lined vinyl
			tablecloth, with melted butter, empty buckets for shells, lobster
			crackers & picks, bibs & lots of napkins, and favorite spices as condiments.
			Gather your family and friends and enjoy your authentic DownEast Lobster Bake.
